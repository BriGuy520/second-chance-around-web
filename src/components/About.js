      <p>
      Co-Founder and CEO Ashley began taking on personal organizing jobs when she found her day job 
      as a nanny becoming less and less time consuming. As she began to help more and more clients with 
      their organizing needs, she kept coming across the same problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first was she would organize a space, return and find it in the same state
        as it was the first time she arrived. A complete mess. This was happening because her
        clients were attempting to store things that were not being used... Over time she honed in on
        on her simplifying skills and crafted a list of loaded questions that helped her clients make
        thoughful decisions about what they needed and what they didn't. And once the clients let all those
        extra things go, the space stayed organized! And we can safely say no one has ever regretted this 
        simplifying process.
      </p>

        Another problem Ashley discovered as an organizer is how much extra work
        is involved with getting rid of everything once you realize you don't need it anymore...
        There are always tons of bags and boxes to donate, trash to take out, items to put back, and most of the time items
        that could be resold to for a little extra pocket change or to help with the expense of the organizing 
        services in general.
